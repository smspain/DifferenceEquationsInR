Difference Equations In R

Last Update: 20 March 2025


This is a package providing utilities to help study, simulate, and analyze discrete dynamical models (especially difference equations) and to fit them to real data.
It also provides some utilities for working with 1- and 2-dimensional cellular automata on a square lattice and boolean networks. 
I have used this pretty extensively, but several functions are still delicate (see especially the liapunov function - this really shouldn't be automated, but, why not give it a shot?)
